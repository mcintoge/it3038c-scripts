Project 2 is a simple python quiz game that tests you on your knowledge of a few common facts on Islam and their holy month. 

To simply run this program, go to the directory you saved the program type "py proj2.py" and then hit enter

This code works by defining a dictionary called questions that contains he quiz question and its answers and the 'play_game()' function runs the game. Variables within the ''play_game function include the max number of guesses and the time limit for each guess, and the scores. I use the random and time modules so that I can time users for each guess andso that the questions are picked randomly everytime the program is ran. Ultimately, the game function will loop throgh all th questions until they are all answered or when the user runs out of guesses/time.
